# Anomaly-Detection

Anomaly are events or items in the dataset that differs from the norm. These events or items are rare in comparison to the normal items in the dataset. Anomaly detection is the process of identifying such outliers. Anomaly detection algorithms have many applications in different domains like Intrution detectiion for Network traffic, Fraud detection in finance, Data leakage Prevention in databases, ECG, CT in Medical domain. Unsupervised algorithms are most commonly used for anomaly detection as they take internal data structure of the dataset into accounts. I will be posting few examples in the repo.
